          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>The graphic above allows us to see how three health factors (percentage of population who are obese, percentage
            of population who smoke, and the percentage of population who lack healthcare) relates to three demographic factors 
            (percentage of population in poverty, median age, and median household income).
          </p>

          <h4>Poverty</h4>
          <p>When looking at the percentage of populations in poverty by state, a few things become apparent. Mississippi has 
            the highest % in poverty, and is among the highest % for all three health factors (obesity, smoking, and lack of 
            healthcare). On the other end of the spectrum are states such as Hawaii or Minnesota, which are have a low percentage 
            of people in poverty and are also on the low end of all three health factors.
          </p>

          <h4>Median Age</h4>
          <p>As we change to median age, many of the states that were in the lowest on the health factors all shift to the 
            higher end on median age; as you would expect, the states that are on the high-end of the health indicators have a 
            lower median age, possibly indicating a lower life-expectancy due to those health factors.
          </p>

          <h4>Household Income</h4>
          <p>As we evaluate household income versus the health factors, there is correlation that becomes apparent. The states with 
            lower median household income are all on the high end of all three health factors; the states with the highest median 
            household incomes are among the lowest on the three health factors. This suggests that as household income increases, 
            opportunities to live a healthier lifestyle with better access to healthcare also increases.
